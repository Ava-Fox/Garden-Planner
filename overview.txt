---- GARDEN PLANNER ----

Overview:

A tool that will help plan a garden by sorting taller plants to the North, avoiding placing "bad buddies" next to one another,
logging the current and past placement of plants for improved suggestions, and possibly sending out weather notifications 
warning of frost or extream heat. Other ideas include gathering data from local resources pertaining to the care of the 
specific plant searched as well as  having a 'wishlist' function where the user can input all the plants they would like to 
grow and be given back information about if they can grow them in their area, when they should plant seeds/transplants, 
and even be notified when it comes time to sew seeds. Another function could be a "bloom-cycle" planner, where instead of planning by 
planting time, you can plan by bloom time in order to coordinate the garden aesthetically, and be given a retroactive
planting guide for your specific repertoire.
