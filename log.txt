      Guess: not properly finding file path because it's looking directly
      in the "templates" folder

    Actually wasn't updating bc auto-reload wasn't configured in app.py

TODO: How the heck do you plot each plot-id in a table?
  I don't get it
  I know each bed should be it's own table, and each local-y is it's own row, and each x is a td.
  How the heck do you do it though???
  I tried passing in the entire plot dataset as a dict through, and looping through each plot individually,
  but I gave up and tried to seperate each bed into it's own dict but that confused me even more. 
  I don't understaaaaand this is definitely possible but I don't know how to go about coding the process
  of plotting each individual datapoint ugh :/
